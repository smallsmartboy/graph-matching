\section{Related Work}

Recommendation systems surveys and main principles: information retrieval techniques such as PageRank and Cosine similarity for finding related pages.


Work on the classification of pages into core and periphery: why the periphery exists because of the long tail.

Any other work on finding subgraphs in batches and use them to navigate sites? (Any relation to BGP tables in internet routing that get updated dynamically? Those are shortest path tables but here we have the choice of many links to recommend.)
