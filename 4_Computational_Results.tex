\section{Computational Results}

We simulated performance of our algorithms on random graphs generated by the
graph models we outlined. The following graphs show that the lower bound we
calculated for the expected performance of the sampling algorithm accurately
captures the behavior of the sampling algorithm when $a=1$. Indeed, the
inequality we used is an accurate approximation of the true expectation, up to
lower order terms. The random sampling algorithm does well, both when $c$ is low
and high, but falters when $ck=1$. The greedy algorithm performs better than the
random sampling algorithm in all cases, but its advantage vanishes $c$ gets
larger. In all the plots below, the red, blue and yellow lines denote the
approximation ratio of the greedy, sampling and partitioning algorithms
respectively.

In contrast to the case when $a=1$, the sampling algorithm performs much more
poorly when $a>1$. In such cases, the sampling algorithm performs well only when
$c$ is large. The greedy algorithm continues to give solutions that are nearly
optimal, regardless of the settings of $c$ and $a$. Therefore, our simulations
suggest that in all cases, the greedy algorithm is a suitable and simple
replacement for solving the problem to optimality.
